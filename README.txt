# Family Hub — Android Setup Guide

## What is this?
Family Hub is a Progressive Web App (PWA). This means it installs 
directly from your phone's browser — no app store needed!

## How to install on Android

1. Copy these files to a web server, OR use the method below.

## Easiest Method — Use a free hosting service

Option A: GitHub Pages (free, easy)
  1. Go to github.com and create a free account
  2. Create a new repository called "familyhub"
  3. Upload all the files from this folder (index.html, manifest.json, sw.js, icons/)
  4. Go to Settings → Pages → Source: main branch
  5. Your app will be live at: https://yourusername.github.io/familyhub/
  6. Open that URL on your Android phone in Chrome
  7. Tap the "Add to Home Screen" banner that appears at the bottom!

Option B: Netlify Drop (easiest — no account needed)
  1. Go to netlify.com/drop in your browser
  2. Drag the entire FamilyHub-Android folder onto the page
  3. It gives you a URL instantly (e.g. https://random-name.netlify.app)
  4. Open that URL on your Android phone in Chrome
  5. Tap "Add to Home Screen"!

## After installing
- The app icon will appear on your home screen like a native app
- Opens fullscreen with no browser address bar
- Works offline once installed (weather requires internet)
- Data is saved locally on the phone

## Notes
- Best used with Chrome on Android
- The blue "Add to Home Screen" bar appears automatically
- If it doesn't appear, tap the 3-dot menu → "Add to home screen"
